1. Add Limit Switches:
   - Install limit switches for safety and precise control at the arm's movement limits.
   - Connect to GPIO pins to detect end stops.

2. Improve Motor Control:
   - Upgrade L298Ns to motor drivers with higher efficiency (e.g., TB6612FNG) to reduce heat and improve performance.

3. Feedback Systems:
   - Add potentiometers or encoders to track servo/motor positions in real-time.

4. Battery Monitoring:
   - Use a voltage divider with an ADC or a dedicated battery monitoring IC to display battery level on the controller.

5. OLED Screen:
   - Add a 1.3-inch OLED screen to display status information (e.g., battery level, connection status).

6. Wi-Fi Connectivity:
   - Add a Wi-Fi module (e.g., ESP8266) for remote control and telemetry.

7. Sensor Integration:
   - Include sensors like ultrasonic or IR distance sensors for obstacle detection.

8. Camera Support:
   - Attach a Pi Camera for vision-based control or remote viewing.

9. Advanced Inverse Kinematics:
   - Improve software to handle more complex arm movements and path planning.

10. Voice Commands:
    - Add a microphone and integrate voice control using AI libraries (e.g., Google Speech-to-Text).

11. Chassis Upgrade:
    - Use better wheels or motors for smoother and more stable movement.

12. Parallel Movement Commands:
    - Enable the arm to process multiple movement commands simultaneously by placing each movement under its own asyncio task.

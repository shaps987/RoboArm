1. Add Limit Switches:
   - Install limit switches for safety and precise control at the arm's movement limits.

2. Improve Motor Control:
   - Upgrade L298Ns to motor drivers with higher efficiency (e.g., TB6612FNG) to reduce heat and improve performance.

3. Battery Monitoring:
   - Use a voltage divider with an ADC or a dedicated battery monitoring IC to display battery level on the controller.

4. OLED Screen:
   - Add an OLED screen to display status information (e.g., battery level, connection status).

5. Sensor Integration:
   - Include sensors like ultrasonic or IR distance sensors for obstacle detection.

6. Camera Support:
   - Attach a Pi Camera for vision-based control or remote viewing.

7. Advanced Inverse Kinematics:
   - Improve software to handle more complex arm movements and path planning.

8. Voice Commands:
    - Add a microphone and integrate voice control using AI libraries (e.g., Google Speech-to-Text).

9. Chassis Upgrade:
    - Use better wheels or motors for smoother and more stable movement.

10. Parallel Movement Commands:
    - Enable the arm to process multiple movement commands simultaneously by placing each movement under its own asyncio task.
